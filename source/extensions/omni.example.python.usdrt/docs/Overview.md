# Overview

An [example Python->C++ extension](http://omniverse-docs.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/kit-extension-template-cpp/106.0.1/index.html) that can be used as a template for creating new extensions.

Demonstrates how to create a Python plugin that can interact with the current USD stage using the USDRT Scenegraph API by:
- Inspecting Fabric data using the USDRT Scenegraph API
- Manipulating prim transforms in Fabric using the RtXformable schema
- Deforming Mesh geometry on the GPU with USDRT and Warp
